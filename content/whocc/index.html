<p>
Since June 2021, CHICAS has been designated as the World Health
Organization Collaborating Centre on Geostatistical Methods for
Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) Research.
</p>

<p>
As part of this initiative, CHICAS has led in the development and
application of geospatial methods for the design and analysis of NTD
surveys, in particular for soil-transmitted-helminths, trachoma and
lymphatic filariasis.
</p>

<p>
Some of our current projects include: design of a surveillance system
for lymphatic filariasis in a post-elimination setting; geostatistical
design of elimination surveys; the development of user-friendly web
applications for NTD survey design and geospatial analysis.
</p>

<p>
These projects have recently involved close collaborations with
Ministries of Health from Brazil, Niger, Malawi, Guyana, Papua New
Guinea and Ethiopia.
</p>
