<h2>Previously...</h2>

My PhD research focuses on finding invariants in spatio-temporal
relationships (networks) between biological species using datasets
collected from different sources, sample methods and
uncertainties. I'm interested in understanding how ecological
relationships are dependent on external biophysical variables
(continuous and periodic). The research involves the development of
tools for handling and analysing remote sensed data and big (maybe not
too big) databases. I work with Open Source and Free Software tools.
