<p>
  For my PhD research, I am working in partnership with Lancashire and
  South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust to improve our understanding of
  inequalities in access to mental health services during the COVID-19
  pandemic through the analysis of routinely collected mental health
  service data. I am particularly interested in exploring if lesbian,
  gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT+) population groups, noted as
  traditionally underserved in the past, have had more or less access
  to services than expected. My research will involve data analysis
  methods to look at changes in service activity over time, map
  patient journeys, and explore the influence of patient
  characteristics and the pandemic. My PhD is funded by the NIHR
  Applied Research Collaboration North West Coast (ARC NWC), who I
  also work with as a Senior Research Assistant in the Implementation
  and Capacity Building Team (IMPaCT) based at the University of
  Central Lancashire (UCLan), adding an implementation lens to applied
  health research projects focused on addressing health inequalities.
