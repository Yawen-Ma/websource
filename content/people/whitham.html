<p>Lauren is no longer in the CHICAS group</p>

<h2>Previously...</h2>

<p>
I am Lauren a part-time postgraduate MD student supervised by Prof Jo
Knight, and Mr Nick Wood, with an interest in gynaecological oncology.
I am currently working in Lancashire Teaching Hospital as a Clinical
Research Fellow.
</p>
<p>
The aim of my study is to produce a pre-operative outcome prediction
model for gynaecological oncology patients undergoing surgery.  This
will be produced using already existing hospital data, and then be
tested on a prospective cohort of patients.  In parallel to this,
patients will also be asked to provide serum, urine and saliva
samples.  These biological samples will also be analysed in a similar
method- forward feature extraction classification algorithm, to assess
if they can be used separately, or incorporated into the model to
improve patient outcome following oncological surgery in gynaecology
patients.
</p><p>
The hope is to create a prediction model that can be utilised to
identify patients in greater need of high dependency care, or to
highlight those who may be at a greater risk of complications
following or during surgery.
