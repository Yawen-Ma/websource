<p>
I am a PhD student on the Medical Research Council Doctoral Training
Partnership between Lancaster University and the Liverpool School of
Tropical Medicine. I am currently enrolled on the Statistics and
Epidemiology PhD at Lancaster University. My supervisory team is made
up of Dr Emanuele Giorgi, Dr Claudio Fronterre and Professor Federico
Costa (Universidad Federal da Bahia, Salvador, Brazil).
</p>
<p>
After graduating as a Veterinary Surgeon from the University of
Liverpool in 2017, I worked in small animal practice for 18
months. During this period, I became increasingly interested in public
health and infectious disease epidemiology, especially of zoonotic
diseases. I decided to pursue these interests and completed an MSc in
Control of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine.
</p>
<p>
My research is focused on analysing how human movement is involved in
infectious disease dynamics. I am using leptospirosis—a zoonotic
bacterial disease transmitted by rats—in urban slums in Brazil as my
main example. My main aims for my PhD include: i) understanding how
human movement can be analysed and incorporated into statistical
models for leptospirosis infection, ii) investigating how risk
perception might affect human movement and iii) evaluating if
structural and community interventions have an effect on human
movement.
</p>
<p>
  I am a firm believer that scientific research should be open and
  accessible to all, so I am making an active effort to ensure my
  writing and presentations are clear, understandable and stylish. I
  also endeavour to bring these values of openness and accessibility
  to my coding. Where possible, I am making my GitHub repositories
  public, using them to publish data and methods I used.
