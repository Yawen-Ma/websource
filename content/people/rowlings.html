<p>
Barry has been working in spatial statistics and GIS technology for some years, publishing in spatial
statistics and software systems development. He has a philosophical objection to closed-source software for
science, and releases as much as possible of his work via open source licenses. 
</p>
<p>
 To encourage advocacy for open source geospatial he works with <a href="http://www.osgeo.org/">OSGEO</a> and was
 on the conference committee for <a href="http://2013.foss4g.org/">FOSS4G 2013</a> in Nottingham. He has also taught 
 several courses on R, mostly with a spatial or geospatial focus.
