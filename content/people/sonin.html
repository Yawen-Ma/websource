I am a first year PhD student in Statistics and Epidemiology, and a
part of the Medical Research Council Doctoral Training Partnership
between the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and Lancaster
University. My supervisors are Dr Emanuele Giorgi and Professor
Federico Costa.
</p>
<p>
My background is in Biomedical Sciences, which I completed in 2017
from the University of Southampton. After this, I did my Masters in
Public Health at Imperial College London, where I subsequently worked
as a research assistant for two years.

My current research focuses on the zoonotic disease leptospirosis, in
urban slums in Salvador, Brazil. I am currently looking at leptospire
shedding by rats into the environment, to understand how this
translates to risk in human infections. I also plan on looking into
the immunological processes of the disease.
