<p>
Simon’s research interests lie at the interface between geography,
health, and computer science, with an emphasis on how people’s
interactions with each other, and their environment, influence
pathways of disease transmission. Having an undergraduate and
masters-level background in physical geography, he completed his PhD
in Complex System Simulation at the University of Southampton, with a
view to gaining the technical skills in dynamic modelling required to
simulate these relationships. Using agent-based modelling (ABM)
techniques, Simon’s research projects include a fine-scale, highly
detailed model of Rhodesian human African trypanosomiasis
(rHAT/sleeping sickness) in Eastern Province Zambia, and an
exploration of human behaviour as a contributory factor to
anti-microbial resistance (AMR) in Uganda and Malawi. In addition to
this core research, his social science background has led to an
interest in the development of software tools that are accessible to
researchers with no formal training in computational methods.

 Away
from university, Simon enjoys rugby, cue sports and has a strong
affinity with the coast (although not as strong as his cockapoo,
 Jess!).
