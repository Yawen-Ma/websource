<h2>Previously...</h2>

<p>
I am a Medical Research Council (MRC) Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP) student (2017-2021)
studying epidemiology and spatial statistics, with a focus on co-occurrence of infectious diseases.
This programme is a collaboration between LSTM and CHICAS. During the first year of the MRC DTP
programme, the MRes in Global Health allowed me to improve new skills such as geospatial and
infectious disease modelling and to broaden my research skills by taking part in multiple research
projects. For my second rotation, I looked at the association between pneumonia and exposure to
ﬁre smoke in the domestic environment in Malawi using data from the Cooking and Pneumonia
study (CAPS). For my third rotation, I spent two months at Yale University where I analysed data
from five years of prospective study using serological and household surveys. The aim was to
perform rigorous examination of the risk factors for leptospiral transmission in a high-risk urban
slum community in Brazil.

My PhD research focuses on determining a suitable spatial sampling design for the DRUM sites in
Uganda and Malawi and on investigating possible co-occurrence of antimicrobial resistance and
typhoid/malaria in these areas. It will also include looking at some of the water, sanitation and
hygiene (WASH) data collected by our partners to investigate potential correlations between the
WASH habits in the study areas and how to better include them in the agent-based model. My PhD is
supervised by Dr Chris Jewell (Lancaster University), Dr Luigi Sedda (Lancaster University) and
Professor Nick Feasey (LSTM); experts in spatial statistics, infectious disease modelling and
microbiology.

I hold a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science and an MSc in Mathematical Engineering for life
sciences from Université Paris Descartes, France.
