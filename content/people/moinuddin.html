I am visiting PhD student in Statistics from the University of Padua,
Italy. My supervisors are Prof Carlo Gaetan from the University of
Venice and Dr Emanuele Giorgi. My project aims to develop a new
“divide and conquer approach” for handling big spatial data in the
case of Gaussian and non-Gaussian outcomes. The computational
efficiency of new algorithm will be tested through simulation studies
and analysis of large data sets from climate and epidemiological
studies.
