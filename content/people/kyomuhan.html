<p>Irene has finished her PhD studies and is no longer in the Lancaster Medical School</p>

<h2>Previously...</h2>

<p>
I am a PhD student at the CHICAS at Lancaster University Medical
School. With a Bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Sciences from Aston
University, and a Master’s degree in Immunology of Infectious diseases
from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, I have a
special interest in the surveillance and control of infectious
diseases in the tropics.
</p>
<p> My previous work includes collection and management of data
for malaria epidemiology studies in Sub-Saharan Africa and south East
Asia, as well as teaching post-graduate immunology. My PhD will focus
on integrating multiple datasets for more efficient tropical disease
prevalence mapping, under the supervision of Emanuele Giorgi and
Luigi Sedda.

Outside academia, I enjoy traveling, live music, and comedy.
