I am a 1st year PhD student in statistics and epidemiology supervised by Dr Anastasia Ushakova and Prof. Kate Cain. I am funded by EPSRC DSI. I am in partnership with Amplify Reading to apply and refine statistical models of early literacy development by looking at childrenâ€™s interactions with a digital reading support.

This project will use data from games that assess vocabulary, morphology, word reading and reading comprehension to identify change in complex developing dynamic systems. My current research concerns using longitudinal model to find the relationship between speed and accurate of the game acoss pupils.
