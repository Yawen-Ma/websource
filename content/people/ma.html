  My current research concerns learning about early literacy
  acquisition through student interactions with research-based game
  environments. I am working on applying and refining statistical
  models to advance understanding of early literacy development
  through analysis of childrenâ€™s interactions with a digital reading
  support that provides practice and explicit instruction in core
  skills - Amplify Reading.
