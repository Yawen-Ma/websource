<p>Emma has finished her studies and is no longer in the Lancaster Medical School</p>

<h2>Previously...</h2>

<p>
I am studying for an MSc in Research with Dave Clancy and Jo Knight.  I
am looking for associations between health outcomes (phenotypes) and
genetic markers (genotypes) in humans using UK Biobank's data
resource, focusing on the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). The mtDNA is
unusual in several ways and these require rethinking analysis before
embarking on a search. This project has significantly extended my
skills in data analysis, statistics and programming.
</p>
<p>
I completed my undergraduate degree at University of Cambridge and
worked in their Genetics department for over five years, specialising
in the genetics and development of Drosophila melanogaster.  My role
centred on "fly pushing", cell sorting and RNA and DNA analysis
techniques, but also extended to project steering commitee meetings,
teaching team members and students, and independent research projects.
</p>
<p>
Outside of work and study, I paint landscapes, support a Scouts group
and look after my family.
