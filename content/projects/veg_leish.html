<p>
Visceral leishmaniasis is primarily contracted through bites from
phlebotomine sandflies, which feed on and live in vegetation. We are
collaborating with the Federal University of Bahia to determine how
the presence of vegetation in close vicinity to a household affects
the odds of contracting the disease. Domestic canine cases are being
studied for this project, since domestic canines are the main
reservoir for human cases in Brazil.
