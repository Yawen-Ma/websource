<p>
Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are at a crucial point in global
policy decision making. Huge investments and global efforts have
reduced the burden of these diseases in many of the poorest
populations of the world but continuing investment is required to
eliminate these diseases as public health problems and to continue
progress from elimination to eradication. Quantitative modelling and
analysis make important contributions to this endeavour. The
Gates-funded <a href="https://www.ntdmodelling.org">NTD Modelling Consortium</a>
is an international team of NTD modellers who are working to support
NTD policy in these areas for seven diseases:

<ul>
  <li>Gambian human African trypanosomiasis</li>
<li>Lymphatic filariasis</li>
<li>Onchocerciasis</li>
<li>Schistosomiasis</li>
<li>Soil-transmitted helminthiasis</li>
<li>Trachoma</li>
<li>Visceral leishmaniasis.</li>
</ul>
</p>

Within the consortium, CHICAS provides statistical expertise to
complement the mathematical modelling expertise of other consortium
members. Our current methodological focus is on the development and
application of geospatial statistical methods for the design and
analysis of prevalence surveys when the disease in question is at or
close to elimination. These include computationally and statistically
efficient methods for real-time health surveillance and optimal
combination of “hard” and ”soft” outcomes (eg prevalence surveys and
mobile technology usage).
