<p>
The Geostat NTD Hub is a prototype of a web-based application that hosts
and manages epidemiological web-apps for sampling design and analysis
of neglected tropical diseases.
</p>
 
<p>
We aim to create an asynchronous, scalable web-based platform that
will be used by health professionals to analyse disease data and
design surveys using model-based geostatistical models.
</p>
 
<p>
Model-based geostatistics (MBG) is a branch of statistics that
provides principled methods of data analysis for mapping spatially
structured diseases and can thus inform effective health policy
planning. One of the main hurdles in the application of MBG methods is
the requirement of advanced statistical expertise and large
computational resources, both of which are uncommon in developing
countries.  The aim of the project is to make these resources
available to professionals in those areas in real time.
