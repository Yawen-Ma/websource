<p>
BEPREP is an EU-funded project spanning 14 institutions. The project
investigates how biodiversity restoration projects alone, or along
with public health interventions, can prevent future
pandemics. Guidence and best practices will be identified through a
number of spatially and temporally replicated case studies. The work
package being undertaken at CHICAS is to provide statistical expertise
to the wider project. This involves the development of novel
spatio-temporal models and their application to relevant diseases. A
current example is Hantavirus in Sweden.
