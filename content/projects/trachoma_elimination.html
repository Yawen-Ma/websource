<p>
Trachoma is the most common infectious cause of blindness worldwide,
  affecting the most deprived and marginalised communities. Concerted
  efforts are being made for the global elimination of trachoma as a
  public health problem by the year 2030. As a World Health
  Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Neglected Tropical
  Disease Research, CHICAS provides support in the design and analysis
  of trachoma prevalence surveys, closely coordinating with WHO,
  health ministries, and other partner organizations and academic
  institutions.

<p>
We use model-based geostatistics to:
<ul>
  <li>Identify the most efficient sampling strategy in the
  country-specific contexts including resource and data availability
  and intervention histories </li>
  <li>Predict trachoma prevalence with greater precision than the
  standard trachoma prevalence survey approach
    </li>
  <li>Provide probability statements, specifically, the likelihood of
  having achieved the elimination target
  </li>
</ul>
