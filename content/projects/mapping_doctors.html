<p>
This NIHR-funded multi-disciplinary research project started in
October 2022 to explore the relationship between medical training and
health inequalities.
</p>
<p>
The problem of not having enough doctors is known as ‘underdoctoring.’ 
We aim to make a major contribution to addressing underdoctoring. Our
study will investigate why doctors work where they work, thinking
about how the healthcare system as a whole is organised as well as
individual choices. We will conduct case studies of three
underdoctored areas, and one site that does not struggle to
recruit. By looking in detail at these areas, we will be able to
understand the differences between places, which will have lessons for
other areas in the UK as well as the areas we are focusing on.
</p>
<p>
  The team is led by Liz Brewster, with Jo Rycroft-Malone, Clifford
  Shelton, Euan Lawson, Luigi Sedda, 
  Michael Lambert and Barry Rowlingson
