Novel health datasets available to research communities such as
routinely collected data can be used to answer a wide range of
data-driven research questions that can directly benefit health
research and practice. Using these data, projects within the group
cover a range of areas including epidemiology, diagnostic accuracy and
health service improvement. We apply existing methods as well as
developing new ones with a number of clinical foci including
Neurology, Respiratory and Mental Health Services as well as Care
Homes. The group works with a diverse range of local and national
organisations such as the Office for Health Improvement and
Disparities (OHID), Office for National Statistics (ONS), the
Integrated Care System and Public Health services within the local
government. In addition we support local NHS data science projects and
groups.
