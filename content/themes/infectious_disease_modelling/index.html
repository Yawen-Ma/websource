<p>
Infectious diseases have health and economic impacts for both humans
and livestock. The CHICAS group works with partners in low-, middle-
and high-income countries to better understand the epidemiology of
infectious diseases, and how and where they transmit. We develop
statistical methodology and generate scientific insights to provide
timely information and understanding of epidemics to inform their
control and eradication. Our projects include a range of applications
(including SARS-CoV-2, influenza and foot-and-mouth) with national and
international academic and public/animal health partners including
Public Health England, the Department of Health and Social care, the
Centre for Disease Control and the World Health Organization.
